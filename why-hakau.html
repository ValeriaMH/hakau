  title: Why Hakau?
  description-1: 'When it comes to a physical good, we know what is necessary to be able to inherit. But when we talk about knowing, we specifically need only one thing: <span class="highlight-strong2">listening.</span>'
  description-2: This is how Hakau is born; from the deepest listening. One who understood that the depths do not know kilometers and that they are as close as inside us; in the blood itself, in the ancestral memory. <span class="highlight-strong2">And then together we make that heritage travel and transcend all time and space through those who have always been treated; of people and their creations.</span> And so life becomes eternal because knowledge is. And those who taught us a bit of everything, are still alive in each creation. May the wisdom of our people travel the entire world, that what is really important always find someone to travel through time and space, through pacha.

  founder2-name: Astrid
  founder2-description: I am Astrid, curious at heart, craftswoman, architect by profession and lover of nature and its rhythms by choice. Since child, the one who asked questions, the stubborn as people used to called me... as a grown up, the one who creates and turns things around. It is from here that I connect with myself and with others with our roots, our gifts and what we can weave together in common to make this experience called life one of the best, being aware of the space we inhabit and the impact we have with our daily acts.
